title: Restaurant - Mazi

If you think Greek food equals plate smashing, unrefined, then you need to visit Mazi.

Traditional greek food with a contemporary twist.

Pretty as a picture.

'Revolutionising Greek food in the UK' is a bold claim, but the gorgeous little spot doesn't disappoint. You won't find stodgy lamb shanks, meze platters and moussaka, just a carefully thought out menu of stylish 'jars' (think feta spread, tzatziki etc), cold plates (the modern greek salad is basically a gigantic tomato stuffed full of black olives, cheese and fresh herbs) and hot plates (the feta tempura is mind-blowing). 

The dishes, supplemented by homemade olive bread, are designed to be shared amongst the table, so while it's visually contemporary, it's also authentically Greek in its old school sensibility. 

I particularly loved Mazi's interior decor. Think, shabby chic brickwork, modern postcards of Greek hanging like bunting (that looks cooler than I've just made it sound), birdcage-style lampshades and the piece de resistance - a back door leading out onto a mediterranean style terrace.
