It wasn't quite the Indian summer we'd been promised, but yesterday was a fabulously sunny Autumn's day, made even more fabulous by my big sis and her friends who're in town for the week, delicious lunch by the canal, and a fantastic art exhibition!

Now let's start with the lunch…

Towpath Caf├® had been on my list of restaurants to try for ages, but being the South West London bumpkin that I am – see numbers 13 and 14 from this <a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/richardhjames/things-people-living-in-south-west-london-know-to-be-true" target="_blank">Buzzfeed</a> if you don't know what I mean – it took me forever to pluck up the courage to trek allll the way to North East London to try it out. And boy, had I been missing out!

Housed in four shallow units along Regent's Canal, Towpath Caf├® has a laid-back rustic vibe, and serves up a simple but delicious breakfast and lunch menu. We managed to snag a table for 6 as soon as we arrived, even the waitress said we were lucky! Between us, we tried most of the lunch menu, from a snack-sized sausage roll with rhubarb ketchup to the heavenly light and moist olive oil and lemon cake, and I can tell you they were ALL delicious!

Even on a crisp Autumn's day, the canal was buzzing with ducks, swans, runners, and cyclists trying to dodge the runners. If we weren't in a rush, we could have spent hours there just watching the world go by, with the only downside being they don't have a loo so you have to use a nearby pub's...

But we were in a rush… to get to the Ai Weiwei exhibition at the Royal Academy!
