In an attempt to boost morale a little at work, we were shown a very funny <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/shawn_achor_the_happy_secret_to_better_work" target="_blank">TED talk</a> by positive psychology advocate, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shawn_Achor" target="_blank">Shawn Achor</a>. He says you can rewire your brain to think happy and positive in 21 days by:
1. Writing down 3 new things you're grateful for each day.
2. Writing down 1 positive experience you've had over the past 24 hours.
3. Exercising for 10 minutes a day.
4. Meditating for 2 minutes a day.
5. Writing 1 quick email each morning thanking or praising someone.

I know the #100happydays challenge isn't quite the same but I guess the principle is similar. I'm now half way through the challenge (original post <a href="http://www.lingyeungb.com/jumping-on-the-100happydays-bandwagon/" target="_blank">here</a>). I don't know if I necessarily feel happier on the whole, but what is true is that I find myself consciously scanning the world each day for things that make me happy. If you take the time out each day, even momentarily, to seek out the positives and appreciate the beauty of small things in life, surely it's only going to make you feel happier in the long term, right...? I shall report back in 50 days!
