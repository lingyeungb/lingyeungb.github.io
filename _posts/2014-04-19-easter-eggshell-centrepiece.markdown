In need of some last minute Easter decoration inspiration? Why not make yourself an omelette and turn the eggshells into a super easy table centrepiece?

Materials:

* Eggs
* Egg carton
* Tiny flower posies


Step 1: Carefully crack the eggs on the top and open up a small hole.
Step 2: Pour out the eggs and wash out the shells.
Step 3: Peel off the membrane on the inside of the shell (you may need some tweezers for this).
Step 4: Wash out the shells again, fill with water and arrange flowers. Voila!

You can mix it up by using herbs or tiny succulents, or fill some of the carton slots with tealight candles or mini chocolate eggs. Don't fancy using a carton? Have them in separate egg cups instead. The rule is there's no rule, so let your creativity run (or shall I say hop?) wild!

Happy Easter! =)
