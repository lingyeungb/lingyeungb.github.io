Whilst I love the rustic shabby chic look, I'm concious not to make the house look tooooo girly as I'm not the only inhabitant!

I think a great way to add a touch of shabby chic to your home without being too OTT is lanterns. You can have a large statement piece right next to the fireplace, or a collection of smaller ones on the mantelpiece. You never know, they may come in handy when there's a power cut!

Here are some of my top picks:

1) Range of lanterns, from ┬ú19.50, <a href="http://www.alisonathome.com/catalogsearch/result/?cat=0&q=lanterns" target="_blank">Alison At Home</a>
2) Mirrored wooden lantern, from ┬ú75, <a href="http://www.nordichouse.co.uk/mirrored-wooden-lantern-p-1338.html" target="_blank">Nordic House</a>
3) Rustic oblong lantern, ┬ú42, <a href="http://shabbystore.co.uk/rustic-oblong-lantern.html" target="_blank">Shabby Store</a>
4) Lattice lantern, ┬ú65, <a href="http://www.notonthehighstreet.com/homescent/product/cream-lattice-lantern" target="_blank">Home Scent at Not On The High Street</a>
5) Zinc metal lantern, ┬ú79.95, <a href="http://www.notonthehighstreet.com/madewithlovecardboutique/product/rustic-finished-lantern" target="_blank">Made With Love Designs Ltd at Not On The High Street</a>

I have also seen some beautiful ones on eBay, in TK Maxx and Home Sense in the past. But they can be a bit hit and miss sometimes, so happy hunting! x

p.s. <a href="http://www.alisonathome.com/get-inspired/pop-at-hof/" target="_blank">Alison at Home</a> is going to have a pop up shop at House of Fraser's Oxford Street Store from 12th to 26th May. I'm hoping they'll have some lanterns on show!
