Don't worry, I'm not about to become a full-on beauty blogger! 

My friends often ask me what my skincare routine is, and my answer has always been "I don't really have one!". Well, I do sort of have one, but I don't always stick to it... Ellie, look away now, I know you're reading this... I'm so lazy that I sometimes dont' even bother taking off my makeup or washing my face at night!

However, I'm proud to announce that spending a couple of weeks with my beauty junkie sister has inspired me to be kinder to my skin, and I now have a routine that I (mostly) stick to!

I suffered from Eczema as a teenager, so apart from my best friend aka hydrocortisone cream, I didn't use many products on my face. I haven't had an outbreak for years now (touch wood!), but I still like to stick to pretty simple brands and products.

In the morning, I wash my face with this <a href="http://www.boots.com/en/Simple-Kind-To-Skin-Vital-Vitamin-Foaming-Cleanser-150ml_1160720/" target="_blank">foaming cleanser from Simple</a>, followed by <a href="http://www.boots.com/en/Simple-Kind-To-Skin-Soothing-Facial-Toner-200ml_1523/" target="_blank">facial toner </a>from the same Kind To Skin range, and this <a href="http://www.boots.com/en/Vichy-Aqualia-Thermal-Light-Pot-50ml_1457243/" target="_blank">Vichy Aqualia Thermal Light cream</a> that my school friend introduced me to a few years ago when she worked at L'Or├®al. 

I know I should be using SPF everyday, but honestly, when my sun exposure during the week is limited to the 6 minute walk between my house and the train station, I think you can cut me a little slack! ;) I think I'm actually ready to try a new face cream though, so perhaps I should look for one with SPF!

Speaking of sun, I'm a huge fan of the <a href="http://www.boots.com/en/Piz-Buin-Allergy-Spray-SPF30-200ml_1039919/" target="_blank">Piz Buin Allergy sunscreen</a> range - it's been so life-changing it deserves its own blog entry! Anyway, I recently discovered their <a href="http://www.boots.com/en/Piz-Buin-in-Sun-Lipstick-SPF-30-High-4-9g_6701/" target="_blank">SPF 30 lipstick</a>, and I absolutely love it! I've been using Vaseline since forever, but this is fast becoming my favourite!

Another new fave is the <a href="http://www.boots.com/en/Origins-New-Smarty-Plants-CC-SPF20-Skin-complexion-corrector_1364533/" target="_blank">Origins New Smarty Plants CC cream</a>, which comes in two shades - light to medium and medium to deep. It's super light, gives your skin a dewy glow without the shine, and literally all you need to do is rub it in like a moisturiser!

I also try to exfoliate once or twice a week. I'm currently using Botanics' <a href="http://www.boots.com/en/Botanics-Shine-Away-Invigorating-Face-Scrub_1493108/" target="_blank">Shine Away face scrub</a>, but I love the <a href="http://eng.theskinfood.com/products/product.asp?prdNo=62" target="_blank">Black Sugar mask and scrub</a> from the Korean brand, Skinfood!

At night, depending on how lazy I feel, I either use the same Simple foam cleanser, or I just wipe my face with <a href="http://www.boots.com/en/Garnier-Micellar-Cleansing-Water-400ml_1440752/" target="_blank">Garnier's micellar cleansing water</a>. I've also been using the Hada CRiE facial cleansing and massaging tool most nights for the last month or so. I haven't yet noticed a huge difference to my skin (probably more so because I've been eating very unhealthily lately...), but I do feel like the massaging has reduced puffiness.

I then put on some <a href="http://www.kiehls.co.uk/skin-care/by-category/eyes-lips/midnight-recovery-eye" target="_blank">Midnight Recovery Eye cream</a> (it's the first time in my life I've used eye cream!!!), followed by the <a href="http://www.kiehls.co.uk/skin-care/by-category/serum/midnight-recovery-concentrate" target="_blank">Midnight Recovery Concentrate</a>, both from Kiehl's. I wasn't sure about using an oil at first; I thought it was going to make my normal-to-oily skin greasier. Now I'm a total convert! It's actually very light (especially since you only need a few drops) and is absorbed quickly. It has a gorgeous lavender scent, and leaves my skin feeling hydrated and silky smooth!

So what's your routine? Do you have any recommendations that I should try out? I'd love to know!
