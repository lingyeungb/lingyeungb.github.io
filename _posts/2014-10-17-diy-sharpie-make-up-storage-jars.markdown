Hi! My name is Lil and I'm a Sharpie glass jar-aholic.

I hope you liked last week's <a href="http://www.lingyeungb.com/diy-sharpie-glass-jar-typography/" target="_blank">Sharpie typography glass jar DIY</a>, because that would make me feel a bit better about my new addiction!

I guess the photos are pretty self-explanatory (and I'm practically falling asleep) so I'm just gonna go ahead and show you my finished products, inspired by <a href="http://www.missetoile.dk/" target="_blank">Miss Etoile's</a> super cute chinaware range!

Night night! x
