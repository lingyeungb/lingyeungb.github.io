Greetings from Argentina!!!

I was going to put together a few moodboards on how to style your home for Christmas. 

As I was looking for inspiration, an email came through from <a href="http://www.anangelatmytable.com/" target="_blank">An Angel At My Table</a> introducing their gorgeous Christmas styles. I decided that there's no way I can beat these so I'm just going to share them with you instead!

**Christmas Country**

Take a walk through the enchanting snow-covered woodlands then snuggle up to your loved one by the cosy log fire with a cup of hot cocoa. My idea of Christmas heaven.

**Christmas Sugar and Spice**

and all things nice... Soft pastels with touches of gold, your home will be opulent enough to host Marie Antoinette!

**Christmas Silver and Frost**

I don't know why, but this reminds me of Christmas in New York. Stroll through the magical Central Park with trees and leaves covered in a sparkly frost before heading back to your Upper East Side penthouse for a classy cocktail party!

**Christmas in Colour**

If silvery monotone isn't your thing, then this theme is sure to brighten up your holidays!

I don't know about you, but I'm torn between Sugar & Spice and Silver & Frost. Luckily for me, I have until I get back from holiday to decide!

I'll try to blog whilst I'm away, but in case I don't get a chance to, follow my holiday adventures on <a href="http://instagram.com/lingyeungb" target="_blank">Instagram</a>!
