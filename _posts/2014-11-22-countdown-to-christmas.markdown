The Oxford Street Christmas lights are on and the Somerset House ice rink is open. This can only mean one thing - the official countdown to Christmas has begun!

With 2 weeks to go until the start of Advent, have you got your advent calendar yet? I've never been a huge fan of advent calendars - why does cheap chocolate always taste like cheese? - but these scrumptiously luxurious calendars (edible or otherwise) have changed my mind!

So let's start with the good old traditional chocolate ones.

**<a href="http://www.hotelchocolat.com/uk/shop/christmas/advent-calendars/large-advent-calendar-to-share" target="_blank">Hotel Chocolat Advent Calendar To Share, ┬ú26</a>**![](/content/images/2014/11/HotelChocolat.jpg)
Finally!!! No more fighting over who gets the chocolate on which day! There are two baby truffles behind each window, ranging from the simple truffles to festive flavours like mulled wine and gingerbread. Yum!

Paul A Young is probably my favourite chocolatier in London, and just look at those cute little wooden houses! They would make the cutest Christmas decorations, AND you can refill them next year with new treats. Now that's what I call environmentally friendly!

If you prefer something a little less dairy and a little more... merry, then check out these Gin Foundry and Drinks By The Dram collaborations.

**<a href="http://gin-foundry.myshopify.com/products/ginvent-calendar" target="_blank">Gin Foundry Ginvent Calendar, from ┬ú114.95</a>**![](/content/images/2014/11/Gin-1.jpg)
To accompany the 24 single-measure bottles of delicious gin, Gin Foundry will be releasing daily information about each gin as well as free daily Twitter tastings to take part in. All you need is a splash of tonic!

If you're not a gin fan, then hopefully this whisky cousin will get you merry! Otherwise, vodka, tequilla, cognac and rum are also on offer!

**<a href="http://shop.lego.com/en-GB/LEGO-Star-Wars-Advent-Calendar-75056" target="_blank">Lego Star Wars Advent Calendar, ┬ú24.99</a>**![](/content/images/2014/11/LegoStarWars.jpg)
Darth Vader in a Santa suit is sure to make any kidult go a bit giddy! It looks like it's sold out on Lego's website but Argos seems to still have stock so be quick!

And now, a little something for beauty lovers. I'm seriously droooooling over these...

**<a href="https://www.benefitcosmetics.co.uk/product/view/candy-coated-countdown-advent-calendar" target="_blank">Benefit Candy Coated Countdown Advent Calendar, ┬ú60</a>**![](/content/images/2014/11/Benefit.jpg)
This limited edition set pretty much has all of Benefit's bestsellers, from Benetint to High Beam to BADgal lash. Sadly this one is also sold out in store but can be found on eBay going for twice the price if you're desperate!

If this set of 24 colourful mini nail polishes and sprinkles doesn't get you party season ready, I don't know what will!

**<a href="http://www.liberty.co.uk/fcp/product/Liberty//Christmas-Beauty-Advent-Calendar-/114431" target="_blank">Liberty Beauty Advent Calendar, ┬ú149</a>**![](/content/images/2014/11/Liberty2.png)
The Liberty website says this is the ultimate indulgence for the festive countdown, and I have to say, it got me at mini Diptique candle and Hourglass Opague Rouge. I think I would find it seriously hard to not just open all 25 windows at once!

**<a href="http://www.harrods.com/product/iconic-24-piece-advent-house//000000000004143276#" target="_blank">Wedgwood Iconic 24-piece Advent House, ┬ú12,000</a>**
![](/content/images/2014/11/Wedgwood2.png)
And last but certainly not least - not the price tag anyway - this super exclusive (only 3 sets were made!) Georgian mansion with 24 handcrafted porcelain ornaments in the iconic Wedgwood blue and white. Slight problem, I don't think my home insurance would cover any damage!
