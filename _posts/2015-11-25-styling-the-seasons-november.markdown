I associate November with my Dad's birthday, so I wanted this month's Styling The Seasons to be an explosion of celebratory twinkles whilst keeping to the more muted tones that I'm naturally drawn to, which also perfectly reflect the darker skies we now have in the UK!

This month, <a href="http://www.apartmentapothecary.com/" target="_blank">Katy</a> and <a href="http://lottsandlots.blogspot.co.uk/" target="_blank">Charlotte</a> have teamed up with my favourite Makelight duo - <a href="https://www.makelight.io/" target="_blank">Emily</a> and <a href="http://www.gatheredcheer.com/" target="_blank">Ruth</a> - to host <a href="https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/stsxmakelight/" target="_blank">STSxMakelight</a> for which everyone's invited to style some seasonal flat lays.

When I first embarked on this little <a href="https://www.instagram.com/lingyeungb/" target="_blank">Instagram journey</a> of mine, I wasn't comfortable with styling lots of elements or doing flat lays, but something clicked when I attended <a href="http://www.lingyeungb.com/makelight-weekend-with-emily-quinton/" target="_blank">Emily's Makelight Weekend</a>.

Whenever I do a flat lay now, it's never just the one. Each one turns into a mini series where I build up the elements and try out different placements and backgrounds. The fairy lights here are inspired by the lovely Emily, and I really had to rein myself in with adding too many Christmassy things (am I allowed to use the C word yet?)! I did struggle with the light - or the lack of! - a bit but I had so much fun doing this STSxMakelight mini series, and I hope it brightens up your wintry days!
