Hello! I hope you liked my <a href="http://www.lingyeungb.com/christmas-gift-guide-the-home-lover/" target="_blank">Christmas gift guide for the home lover</a>!

Today I'm going to share with you my top Christmas present picks for the foodies in your life, whatever your budget!

From left to right, top to bottom:

<a href="http://www.vintagewinegifts.co.uk/acatalog/rent-a-vine.html" target="_blank">Rent a row of Saint Emilion Grand Cru vines</a>, ┬ú159.97
Might as well start with the most unusual one! We've all given bottles of wines as presents a million times, but have you ever thought of giving someone a little row of their own (rented) vineyard? This unusual gift includes a gift certificate, three bottles of wine from their 2008-2010 vintages, a four-piece wine accessories set, a limited edition print, and the opportunity to visit the Chateau for a personal tour and wine tasting!

<a href="http://www.jamieathome.com/dining/oven-to-table/terracotta-deep-casserole-dish-with-lid.html" target="_blank">Jamie Oliver terracotta deep casserole dish</a>, ┬ú37.50
When it comes to casserole dishes, Le Creuset isn┬┤t the only option! This simple and rustic casserole dish has a 3 litre capacity which makes it perfect for that leftover Christmas turkey pie!

<a href="http://www.procook.co.uk/product/porcelain-egg-holder-white" target="_blank">ProCook porcelain egg holder</a>, ┬ú4
A bargain at ┬ú4, this sleek egg holder is a fashion statement piece for any countertop!

<a href="http://www.fortnumandmason.com/c-1684-christmas-hampers.aspx" target="_blank">Fortnum and Mason Christmas hamper</a>, from ┬ú45
Personally, I think Fortnum & Mason do the BEST Christmas hampers! Not only are the contents always yummy, there is something so luxurious and elegant about the F&M logo on the basket, whether you go for the ┬ú45 option or the ┬ú5000 one (the one pictured here is the Classic Christmas hamper at ┬ú150).

<a href="http://www.johnlewis.com/kitchenaid-artisan-stand-mixer/p231560698?colour=Almond%20Cream" target="_blank">KitchenAid Artisan mixer</a>, from ┬ú379.99
Ahh, I honestly don┬┤t know how I used to bake with a handheld mixer! Yes, the KitchenAid Artisan mixer is expensive (I bought mine in Macy┬┤s in the US which was MUCH cheaper - I did have to buy a high performance transformer though), but it is just incredible! It comes in a range of colours to match your kitchen decor, and there┬┤s a free ice cream maker attachment offer on at John Lewis until 24th December!

<a href="http://www.josephjoseph.com/product/nest-9-plus" target="_blank">Joseph Joseph Nest 9 Plus food preperation set</a>, ┬ú44
Joseph Joseph is the daddy of stylish and innovative kitchenware. This rainbow coloured set ranges from measuring spoon to colander to non-slip mixing bowls. They all neatly stack inside each other, making it perfect even for the tiniest of kitchens!

<a href="http://www.lakeland.co.uk/16046/R-Evolution-Cuisine-Kit" target="_blank">R-Evolution molecular gastronomy cuisine kit</a>, ┬ú44.99
Know someone who┬┤s the next Heston in the making? Get them this kit, and hopefully you┬┤ll be invited to try out one of the 50 recipes on DVD. How do "mint caviar beads that burst in the mouth, chocolate spaghetti, lemon foam or tzatziki spheres" sound?

<a href="http://direct.asda.com/george/george-home/George-Home-Chalked-Milk-Carton/001467117,default,pd.html?cgid=D24M13G01C04" target="_blank">George Home ceramic chalked milk carton</a>, ┬ú3
Another bargain!!! This George by Asda ceramic milk carton would make a cute little addition to anyone┬┤s breakfast routine!

<a href="http://www.johnlewis.com/mary-berry-ramekins-set-of-2/p1405446" target="_blank">Mary Berry ramekins</a>, ┬ú15 for a set of 2
If you know a Great British Bake Off fan, this lovely ramekin set from Queen Mary Berry's kitchen products range would make an ideal pressie! Just don┬┤t forget to (strongly) hint at your favourite pudding!
