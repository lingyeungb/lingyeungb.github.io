Do you remember I was going to buy this <a href="http://www.ikea.com/gb/en/catalog/products/50238815/ target="_blank">TR├àDKL├ûVER fabric</a> when I was planning my <a href="http://www.lingyeungb.com/our-next-ikea-pilgrimage/" target="_blank">Ikea pilgrimage</a> a little while ago?

I bought it, couldn't decide what to do with it, but then I had a lightbulb moment! I could frame it as wall art for the loft bedroom as the decor is a bit dull (argh, I cannot wait to re-build the loft!)!

Materials:

* Picture frames (whatever size and number take your fancy)
* Fabric
* Pinking shears or normal scissors

Step 1: Iron the fabric to remove any crease.

Step 2: Map out which sections you want to frame by placing the frames (with insert and backing removed so you can see through) over the fabric. I wanted mine to be centred around the middle of the "burst" pattern.

Step 3: Cut the fabric to fit the frames. Make sure each piece is slightly bigger than the frame insert size so you don't see the edges through the glass.

Step 4: The rest is pretty self explanatory! ;)

I wish there was more for me to say... but that's it! Voila!
