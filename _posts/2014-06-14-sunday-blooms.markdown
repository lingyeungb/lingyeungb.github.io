If you're looking for some outdoor inspiration this weekend, I'd say nothing beats a trip to Columbia Road Flower Market to pick up some fresh blooms on a sunny Sunday! And 'tis the season for some of my favourites - peony (Jimbo calls them e-ponies, lol!), hydrangea, ranunculus and anemone!

But just before you go, here are a few tips I hope you'll find useful!

1) Be mentally prepared that you will have to elbow your way through the crowd. I got whacked in the face last time by a huge bunch of pussy willow that some guy was carrying over his shoulder...

2) The market is usually open until 2-3pm, so go just before closing time to bag a bargain or two.

3) Carry enough cash with you because as far as I can tell, there are no free cash machines in the area.

4) Also check out the nearby shops, cafes and buskers. Stop for cake at <a href="http://www.lilyvanilli.com/the-bakery/" target="_blank">Lily Vanilli</a>, and maybe even combine the visit with a trip down to Shoreditch, Brick Lane and Spitalfields Market if you don't normally hang out in the area.
