You may remember that I took on the #100happydays challenge a little while ago (original post <a href="http://www.lingyeungb.com/jumping-on-the-100happydays-bandwagon/" target="_blank">here</a> and half way update <a href="http://www.lingyeungb.com/half-way-through-100happydays/" target="_blank">here</a>).

Now that it's officially over, what's my verdict? Honestly, I don't think I feel any happier or otherwise. Well, that's not entirely true - I do feel happier in general but I don't think it's necessarily because of the challenge. It's more of a timely coincidence that I've had a pretty exciting few months with holidays, the new house, and therefore finally an excuse to do all my DIY projects that I've been dying to do for months (if not years).

I actually read some reviews that people felt *un*happier after taking part. Some of the reasons include the pressure to find something tangible to take a photo of each day, or worse, the guilt they felt if they didn't find something or missed a day, and the fear of appearing smug / shallow / vain, etc on social media. 

So would I recommend it? I'm pretty neutral on this one. Personally, I take a million photos anyway, and I'm much more of a visual rather than verbal person, so finding things to take photos of to convey my feelings isn't difficult for me. Although completing the challenge hasn't contributed to my being happier, it serves as a nice little photo journal of a very exciting new chapter in my life.

I would love to hear from anyone else who's completed the challenge. If you'd like to share your story, please leave a comment on my <a href="https://www.facebook.com/lingyeungb" target="_blank">Facebook page</a>! x
