Few things in life make me happier than being surrounded by amazing food, which is why I love <a href="http://boroughmarket.org.uk/" target="_blank">Borough Market</a> - London's oldest, largest, and most famous food market. I hadn't been since it had a facelift last year, but more than made up for it by going twice in the last 3 weekends! 

Going to Borough Market takes a certain kind of patience though - you need to embrace the chaos and stay calm in the long queues (especially on a Saturday), but I guarantee you it's worth it! Here you'll find pretty much everything you can imagine - cheese (lots of it), charcuterie, baked goodies, exotic burgers, fruit and veg, spices, preserves, coffee, unusual beers and ales - it's always a struggle to decide which stall to hit first!

My starter usually comes in the form of oysters...![](/content/images/2014/Sep/_MG_3553.JPG)

followed by the super yum chorizo burger from <a href="http://www.brindisa.com/" target="_blank">Brindisa</a>. The truffle honey from <a href="http://boroughmarket.org.uk/tartufaia-truffles-2" target="_blank">Tartufaia Truffles</a> may not be everyone's cup of tea but you should definitely give the taster a go!![](/content/images/2014/Sep/Collage8.png)

You'll find all sorts of weird and wonderful veggies![](/content/images/2014/Sep/Collage2-1.png)

but Jimbo isn't so fond of all the shooms! ![](/content/images/2014/Sep/IMG_3347.JPG)

<a href="http://boroughmarket.org.uk/furness-fish-game" target="_blank">Furness Food Hut</a> serves up paella, curries, and salt and pepper squid![](/content/images/2014/Sep/IMG_3329.JPG)

or you can pick up some spices and flavoured salts from <a href="http://boroughmarket.org.uk/fitz-fine-foods-2" target="_blank">Fitz Fine Foods</a> to make your own.![](/content/images/2014/Sep/Collage7.png)

There are some fancy charcuterie and cheese stalls![](/content/images/2014/Sep/fromage.png)

or if you're after an instant fromage hit, head to <a href="http://boroughmarket.org.uk/kappacasein-2" target="_blank">Kappacasein</a> for their raclette and cheese sandwich![](/content/images/2014/Sep/_MG_3566.JPG)

<a href="http://www.gelateria3bis.co.uk/" target="_blank">Gelateria 3 Bis</a> probably has the best pistachio ice cream I've ever tasted. AND they have a chocolate tap! What more could you possibly want?![](/content/images/2014/Sep/Collage6.png)

<a href="http://www.konditorandcook.com/" target="_blank">Konditor and Cook's</a> chocolate brownies are to die for and I don't even have a sweet tooth! I'm still undecided which is my fave - Boston or Fudgepacker?!

I don't really drink much coffee these days but you only need to look at the length of <a href="http://www.monmouthcoffee.co.uk/our-shops/the-borough" target="_blank">Monmouth's</a> constant queue to know that their coffee is good!![](/content/images/2014/Sep/IMG_3324.JPG)

If coffee isn't your thing, you can always opt for something a little stronger ;)![](/content/images/2014/Sep/IMG_3363-1.JPG)

And this is possibly the randomest stall in the entire market... I guess you can lose weight by chopping off your hair after stuffing your face?!![](/content/images/2014/Sep/IMG_3351-1.JPG)
