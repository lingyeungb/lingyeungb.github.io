London flower lovers, I have some exciting news (and a freebie!!) for you! Following its successful launches in Amsterdam and Berlin, <a href="http://www.bloomon.co.uk/rdqa7a/" target="_blank">Bloomon</a>, a subscription based fresh flowers delivery company, has opened shop in London!

Bloomon's philosophy is all about spreading happiness and beauty through delivery of freshly cut seasonal blooms from the growers straight to your front door. By cutting out the auctions, wholesalers and shops, Bloomon's flowers arrive still a "little sleepy" but perk up soon after you trim them and give them a nice drink of water. Cutting out the steps in between also mean that you get to enjoy extra days of freshness, and I can attest that my first bouquet - <a href="http://bloomon.co.uk/blog/2016/02/25/tropical-vibes/" target="_blank">Tropical Vibes</a> - lasted well over 2 weeks!

Each week, Bloomon's artisan designs a new bouquet based on the freshest seasonal blooms available. They are then lovingly handwrapped in a sturdy recycled paper wrap filled with little hints and tips so you really have no excuse not to take care of the bouquet properly!

The bouquets come in three sizes (small, medium, large) and you can choose to receive them weekly, fortnightly, or monthly. Deliveries (anywhere within the M25) are made on Wednesdays and you can choose from the daytime and evening timeslots. Not at home? You can nominate a friendly neighbour or a safe place. Going on holiday? Just hit pause and resume when you return. Simples (with my best meerkat accent on)!
