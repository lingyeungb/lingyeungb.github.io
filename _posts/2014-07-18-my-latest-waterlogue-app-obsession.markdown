Meet my new best friend, the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/waterlogue/id764925064?mt=8" target="_blank">Waterlogue app</a> that turns pretty photos into stunning watercolour images. I discovered the app a few months ago, and I probably should be attending Waterlogue Anonymous if it exists. 

The app is very user-friendly. Similar to Instagram, it has 12 pre-set painting styles to choose from. It also has a few additional options like borders, light/darkness, and brush size. I'm not going to pretend to be an expert, but from what I've read, the app simulates a real painting process, and I just love the results! And the best part is, you can either save them as high resolution images and get them printed, or you can order 4" x 6" postcards directly from the app (they are $2.99 a pop though)!

It isn't perfect though, and I find some photos work better than others. For instance, the app lacks details when it comes to faces (you get weird black blobs as eyes which can be a bit freaky!) unless it's a close up portrait. Personally, I've enjoyed using it on flowers and landscape the most, but I guess once you start playing around with it, you'll get a feel for what works best.

Here are some of my favourites so far!
