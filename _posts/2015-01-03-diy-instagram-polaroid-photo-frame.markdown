Happy New Year! Hope you all had a fantastic time ringing in 2015!

ling yeung b had a lovely start to the new year! Do you remember this <a href="http://www.lingyeungb.com/diy-sharpie-make-up-storage-jars/" target="_blank">DIY Sharpie makeup storage jar</a> that I made a little while ago? Style At Home magazine spotted it on Instagram, got in touch and featured it in their <a href="https://www.facebook.com/lingyeungb/photos/a.266752093507660.1073741829.258964014286468/367128340136701/?type=1&theater" target="_blank">February issue</a> that went on sale yesterday! =)

So with a copy in my hand, I went home in high spirits and had the urge to make something!

I had some of my favourite Instagram photos printed in Polaroid style through <a href="https://www.printed.com/order/instagram/73" target="_blank">printed.com</a> over the Christmas period, so I decided to make a pretty display with them!

Materials:

* Large photo frame (mine's an old one from Ikea)
* Twine
* Masking tape
* Staple gun and staples
* Photos
* Mini clothes pegs

Step 1: Cut the twine and tape to the back of the frame however you like.

Step 2: I was hoping the masking tape itself would be strong enough to hold the twine up but it wasn't, so I used a staple gun to secure the twine. Just make sure the staples are shorter than the depth of the frame!

Step 3: Clip the photos onto the twine. Decorate if you wish - I used little dried hydrangea petals.

I think this is a great way to display photos, and it's so easy to change them as and when you wish. It'll also make a great seating plan for weddings or a backdrop for parties!
