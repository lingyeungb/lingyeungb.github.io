One month after our <a href="http://www.lingyeungb.com/our-next-ikea-pilgrimage/" target="_blank">Ikea pilgrimage</a> (I have to admit, we made two trips...), I finally got round to doing the <a href="http://www.horchow.com/Lovelace-Coffee-Table-lovelace/cprod94010001___/p.prod?icid=&searchType=MAIN&rte=%252Fsearch.jsp%253FN%253D0%2526Ntt%253Dlovelace%2526_requestid%253D27215&eItemId=cprod94010001&cmCat=search" target="_blank">Horchow-Lovelace-coffee-table-inspired</a> VITTSJ├û Ikea hack that I promised I'd do!

I can't take full credit for coming up with the idea though, as similar hacks have been done many times before. What I'm going to show you is a combination of (what I think are) the best ideas, and how I approached the challenge!

Materials:

* <a href="http://www.ikea.com/gb/en/catalog/products/80215332/" target="_blank">VITTSJ├û nest of tables</a> from Ikea
* 8 packs (16 handles) of 106mm <a href="http://www.ikea.com/gb/en/catalog/products/90138833/" target="_blank">METRIK handles</a> from Ikea
* Gold spray paint (I used one 340g can of <a href="http://www.diy.com/nav/decor/paint-woodcare/creative-project-paints/metallic_paints/-specificproducttype-metallics___spray_paints/Valspar-Metallic-Effect-Spray-Paint-Gold-Effect-400ml-13199343?skuId=13680047" target="_blank">Valspar metallic gold</a> spray paint from B&Q)
* 45 x 90cm sheet of self-adhesive marble effect vinyl film (I got mine from eBay)
* Super glue
* Scissors

Step 1: Protect the surface you're going to spray on and lay out all the parts.

Step 2: Follow the instructions on the can, and spray the parts with 2 coats of paint, making sure all sides are covered. That said, I think slight patchiness, like foxing on mirrors, is actually quite pretty and gives the piece a more vintage feel. The spray paint that I chose  has a shimmery antique gold finish, which goes well with my vintage French chandelier, but you can use any finish (or colour for that matter) you want!

Step 3: Whilst the paint is drying, cover one side of the base board with the vinyl. I covered the sides as well so that the edges don't peel off, plus it makes it look more like real marble! Trim off excess along the bottom edges.

Step 4: When everything is dry, assemble as per Ikea's manual.

Step 5: Super glue the handles onto each corner of the coffee table. I chose to have the horizontal one on the front, and the vertical one on the back, but that's entirely up to you.

And that's it! A few hours' effort, and you can transform this boring ┬ú45, well, ┬ú83 including all other materials, coffee table
