Armed with the best doggy bag ever - pork and fig terrine on toasted baguette and smoked salmon bagel - from <a href="http://www.lingyeungb.com/merci-paris/" target="_blank">Merci</a>, we decided to take a long stroll to Parc des Buttes-Chaumont in the 19th arrondissement. 

It's perhaps less well known to tourists but it's got amazing views and is the perfect spot for a picnic, especially one with fresh cherries from the fruit stall and an ice cold beer - ironically, a Tsing Tao picked up at the Chinese supermarket on the way...!

We considered getting married at Temple de la Sibylle, right at the top here. It would have been beautiful but I'm not sure I would have survived in my dress and heels!

After our picnic, we took the metro to Notre Dame.

And then one of my favourite activities in Paris - walking along the River Seine and admiring all the stunning bridges!

Think you recognise this bridge but aren't quite sure...? It is indeed Pont des Arts, but without the love locks! Instead, panels of locks have been replaced with some (super cute) temporary artwork.

This is where our lock would have been... but I'm not complaining!

After all that walking, it was clearly time for food again... ;) 

<a href="http://www.ag-restaurant.fr/" target="_blank">Restaurant AG</a> has been named one of the top 10 newcomers on the Parisian foodie scene, and I am not the least bit surprised! 

We went for the 5 course Menu découverte with (the most generous) wine pairing coz when in Paris, that's what one does... right? The meal started with the most delicious melt-in-the-mouth parmesan and squid ink biscuits but they were so quickly devoured that there was no chance for a photo!

![](/content/images/2015/07/IMG_1226.JPG)Second entrée - Pan seared langoustine / Green gnocchis / Black garlic / Almond milk for me, and Tuna / Black sesame seeds / Beetroot for the hubs as he has a shellfish allergy, paired with Domaine de la Meuli├¿re Petit Chablis 2013

![](/content/images/2015/07/IMG_1230.JPG)Poisson - Yellow pollock / Artichoke and vinaigrette sauce with pepper/ Courgette / Anchovy, paired with a 2014 Domaine Henri Beurdin Reuilly Blanc

![](/content/images/2015/07/IMG_1232.JPG)Viande - it wasn't on the a la carte menu so I'm just gonna call it "the (perfectly cooked) beef", paired with Domaine de la Chevalerie Bourgueil Diptyque 2013 

![](/content/images/2015/07/IMG_1234.JPG)Dessert - Yuzu / Meringue / Shortbread biscuit / Sorbet, paired with a glass of Marie Hanze champagne

These photos - the quality deteriorated over the night as I got more filled up with wine - really don't do the food justice. Had I known that each plate was going to be a piece of art, I would have brought my proper camera! Well, at least now I have an excuse to return, right? ;)
