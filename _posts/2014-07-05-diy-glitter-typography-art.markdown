What does one do at almost midnight on a school night, surrounded by nothing but dust and boxes of stuff? Make art <del>and more mess</del>, apparently!

Drinks trolley or bar cart styling is all the rage right now. I bought a vintage cast iron drinks trolley a couple of months ago but it's been hidden away whilst all the building work is going on. Now that the renovation work is almost coming to an end, I cannot wait to stock and style it! And what's more apt than an alcohol-related typography print?

I received this print as a Christmas present a couple of years ago. Whilst the idea is really cool, the monochrome palette wasn't very exciting, so I decided to jazz it up a bit!

Materials:

* Typography print (on canvas or high grade paper)
* Mod podge or generic school glue
* Sponge or paint brush
* Glitter

Step 1: Paint a little bit of glue over the letters you want to glitterfy (is that a word?).


Step 2: Whilst the glue is still wet (you probably have time to do a few letters at a time), pour a generous amount of glitter over it. Repeat until all letters are done.

Step 3: Leave it to dry, or if you're impatient like me, help it along a little by pressing the glitter down vertically.

Step 4: When the glue is completely dry (you can test this by gently brushing the excess glitter away to see if the last bits are stuck to the letters), shake or brush off excess glitter.

I found that the glue leaked a bit into the canvas grain so the edges for the smaller letters weren't quite so clean, but perhaps it adds to the blurry drunken eye test character of the print!
