I may be a little late to the party, but better late than never, right? 

The last 18 months or so have been a bit of an emotional roller-coaster for me. What I've noticed is that it's so easy to focus on the negatives in life and forget how blessed I really am. I recently came across the 100 Happy Days challenge and I think this is the perfect way to make me appreciate the small things in life, and remind myself that I have so much to be happy about and thankful for!

More information can be found <a href="http://100happydays.com/" target="_blank">here</a>, but essentially all you have to do is sign up, choose your preferred platform (mine's Instagram - @lingyeungb), and post a photo of what makes you happy each day using the hashtag #100happydays!

Apparently 71% of people who signed up failed to complete the challenge, saying they didn't have enough time. I'm snappy happy by nature (blame those Chinese genes :p) so hopefully I won't fail!

I'm kicking off my \#100happydays with the official launch of this blog and I challenge you to join the challenge! x
