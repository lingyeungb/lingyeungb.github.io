Remember I said <a href="http://www.lingyeungb.com/my-latest-waterlogue-app-obsession/" target="_blank">last time</a> that you can get postcards printed directly through the Waterlogue app? Well, mine's arrived, and I'm loving it!

The quality of the glossy cardstock is nice, and it arrived within a week in very good condition. At $2.99 (including postage to anywhere in the world) a postcard, I probably won't be ordering more for framing, but I'll definitely consider sending them to friends and family when on holiday for a personal touch!
