I experimented with 3 savoury (and slightly sweet) cupcake recipes today for a dear friend's 30th birthday party.

I'm pleased to report that they were very well received!!!

Recipes to follow, but I couldn't wait any longer to show you how they turned out!

From left to right: Chorizo with paprika mash frosting, smoked salmon with aioli cream cheese, tomato and parmesan with pesto mash frosting
