Sorry for not blogging for over a week - just got back from holiday on Monday! Our family visits to Toronto usually involve eating ourselves silly and hitting Niagara Falls, but this time, we played some table tennis, hung out with my cousin's adorable toddler, and another cousin and his girlfriend took us out for something a little different, fun and creative!

First stop, we had dinner at <a href="http://rawlicious.ca/" target="_blank">Rawlicious in Markham</a>. I was a little skeptical about a full-on raw, vegan meal at first, but in the end, I really enjoyed it! Maybe it also helped that mine was the biggest portion! ;)

After wolfing down our food in lightning speed, we headed next door to the <a href="http://www.paintlounge.ca/" target="_blank">Paintlounge</a>, where we spent the next couple of hours painting cherry blossoms on canvas. The Paintlounge is, as its name suggests, a lounge (more of a cafe really) where you can paint! They run regular workshops with various difficulty levels, as well as host kids, birthdays, hen (bachelorette if you're Canadian/American) and corporate parties. All the materials you need are provided - even coffee and cake! - and you don't need to know anything about painting as they have artist staff on hand to teach you simple techniques and guide you through the workshop.

We had such an awesome time, and it was really interesting to see how different everyone's style was! Here are some piccies of our masterpieces!
