Just got back from an amazing few days in Morocco. Apart from the awesome wedding and Sahara desert trip, my other highlight is (of course!) a mini shopping spree in the Marrakech medina. I can't wait to show you my purchases once the new house is done up! In the meantime, if you'd also like to bring the warmth and vibrancy of the Moroccan souks into your own home, here are some of my top picks from UK and online shops.
