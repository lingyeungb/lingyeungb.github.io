Whatever your view on wars, you cannot deny that #TowerPoppies is a spectacular installation and a moving tribute to mark the centenary of the first full day of Britain's involvement in World War One.

Entitled <a href="http://poppies.hrp.org.uk/about-the-installation" target="_blank">"Blood Swept Lands and Seas of Red"</a>, the installation has been evolving each day since 5th August, with the last of the 888,246 ceramic poppies - each marking a British military fatality during the First World War - to be planted today, on Armistice Day.

If you live in London and haven't been yet, today is your last chance to see them all in this magnitude. From tomorrow, most of the poppies will be dismantled and sent to their new owners (money raised will go to six service charities).

Don't despair though if you can't make it today. Part of the installation - the weeping window and wave segments - will remain on display until the end of the month. Several thousands of the poppies will also go on a UK tour until 2018 before being placed in the Imperial War Museum.

Here are some photos I took in the last couple of days...
