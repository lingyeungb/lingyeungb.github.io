We're planning an Ikea trip next Sunday and I'm super excited (sad I know...)! I'd like to pretend that Jimbo is as excited as I am about Ikea, but bribing him with meatballs and lingonberry jam usually does the trick! ;)

I can wander around for hours, but since we only have one free weekend before our first set of guests arrive at the <del>bombsite, I mean,</del> house, I need a plan of attack.

Top of my list is probably the <a href="http://www.ikea.com/gb/en/catalog/categories/departments/bedroom/19087/" target="_blank">STOLMEN storage system (5)</a> for our newly built walk-in-and-out wardrobe / dressing area. We've been struggling to find a traditional wardrobe that we like (that doesn't cost thousands), and since we (mainly I) have so much stuff, the STOLMEN is going to perfect as it's based on adjustable floor-to-ceiling poles, which means we can utilise the full ceiling height.

Next on the list are a <a href="http://www.ikea.com/gb/en/catalog/products/80215332/" target="_blank">VITTSJ├û coffee table (1)</a> and <a href="http://www.ikea.com/gb/en/catalog/products/20213312/" target="_blank">shelving units (4)</a> for the living room, but I'm going to spruce them up a little bit, so watch this space!

Once the necessities are out of the way, I want to decorate the house with photos and artwork. I can't tell you how excited I am that we can finally put nails in the walls without having to worry about angry landlords! I might just end up buying their entire stock of <a href="http://www.ikea.com/gb/en/catalog/categories/series/16456/" target="_blank">RIBBA picture ledges and frames (6)</a> and <a href="http://www.ikea.com/gb/en/catalog/categories/series/18537/" target="_blank">VIRSERUM frames (8)</a> (and I'm not joking...)!

Ikea also does some really lovely fabrics. You wouldn't believe how difficult it is to find a nice, cotton, black and white striped fabric that's got stripes of a sensible width! After searching high and low, I finally found this <a href="http://www.ikea.com/gb/en/catalog/products/90160027/" target="_blank">Sofia broad-striped fabric (3)</a>, and at ┬ú6 a metre, it's a steal! I also came across this <a href="http://www.ikea.com/gb/en/catalog/products/50238815/" target="_blank">TR├àDKL├ûVER fabric (7)</a> that's so pretty and comtemporary. I haven't quite figured out what exactly I'd do with it yet. Maybe some artwork, or I suppose if in doubt, cushion covers.

Oh, I forgot about this true necessity, the <a href="http://www.ikea.com/gb/en/catalog/products/30178884/" target="_blank">BEKV├äM step ladder stool (2)</a> for the kitchen coz the stupid cabinet doors open upwards and I can't reach once they are fully open to close them again, grr!
