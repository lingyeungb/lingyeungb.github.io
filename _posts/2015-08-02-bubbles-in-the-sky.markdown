I do have one last Parisian adventure to share with you (you can catch the first day of my weekend trip <a href="http://www.lingyeungb.com/merci-paris/" target="_blank">here</a> and <a href="http://www.lingyeungb.com/summer-strolls-in-paris/" target="_blank">here</a>), but I wanted to slip this one in before it's too late!

<a href="http://www.searcysthegherkin.co.uk/" target="_blank">Searcys at The Gherkin</a> is normally a (London's highest!) private members' club, but for the next few weeks it's opening its doors to us hoi polloi!

If you're looking for a slice of peace and quiet away from the hustle and bustle of the City, look no further, well, higher - 180 metres to be precise - than their 40th floor bar that has been transformed into a Moroccan sky riad for the summer!

I honestly think I have the worst luck when it comes to booking somewhere with a view... the weather gods never seem to want to cooperate! But despite the grey skies, the 360-degree view of good ol' London was still glorious! I mean, how could anyone not fall in love with this?

After finishing our pre-dinner bubbles, we headed downstairs to the restaurant on the 39th floor. They're also serving a <a href="http://www.searcysthegherkin.co.uk/Gherkin_Restaurant_Menu.pdf" target="_blank">5 course Moroccan influenced tasting menu</a> but we opted for the normal <a href="http://www.bookatable.co.uk/searcys-at-the-gherkin-aldgate-fenchurch-street-tower-hill-london?lcid=102726&pid=82111&indirect=226&utm_source=UKStarDeal&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=LondonStarDealGherkin24072015&csm=535510632&csc=697655&csa=682303002&csu=697709" target="_blank">3 course menu with a glass of champagne</a> instead.

<img src="/content/images/2015/08/collage2.jpg"/><span style="display:block; text-align: left; margin:0; padding: 0; font-size:8pt;">Starter: smoked duck, white peach, candied walnut, rocket | seared scallop, strawberry, basil
Main: butter roasted monkfish, Heritage carrot, crisp bone marrow, Alsace bacon foam | Gressingham duck breast, raspberry, tarragon, girolle
Dessert: cherry "Bakewell" salted almond ice cream | lemon cheesecake, strawberry and basil sorbet</span>

Food at landmark restaurants is often hit and miss, but we were both pleasantly surprised. I'm not normally a huge dessert fan but that strawberry and basil sorbet was divine! In fact, I think I'm going to have to try and recreate it at some point!
